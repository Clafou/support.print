title: Printing Canceled â€“ Truncation In Margins
categories: [Troubleshooting]
---

This warning occurred because the printer has reported non-printable margins, and parts of your image are in those non-printable margins.

## Why did I get a blank print?

If the app had tried to print anyway, then your print could have been wrong, wasting your ink and paper. Instead you can reuse your blank sheet of paper and print again.

## What can I do to fix this issue?

You can now see dotted lines indicating where the margins are. If necessary, move your images so they are not truncated by the dotted lines. Then just print again.
