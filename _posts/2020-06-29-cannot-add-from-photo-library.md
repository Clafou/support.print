If you are experiencing issues with the photo library accessed via the + button, please try the following:

## Check That The App Has Access To Your Photos

* Open your Settings app
* Tap on Privacy
* Tap on Photos
* Tap on Print to Size
* If "Never" is selected, please change it to the other option, "Read and Write".

## Not Fixed? Try Restarting Your Device

If your Photo Library uses iCloud, there may be an iCloud-related issue. Sometimes a full restart solves such problems. [Click here to read how to restart your iPhone or iPad.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201559)

## Still Not Working?

The + button is not the only way to add images. You can also use Copy/Paste, and additionally on iPad you can use drag & drop. [See this page for instructions.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-11-11-add-an-image.md %})
