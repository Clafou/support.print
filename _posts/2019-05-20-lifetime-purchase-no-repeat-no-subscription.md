title: Your Invoice from Apple – Not a Subscription
categories: [Refunds, Troubleshooting]

When you buy an app like Print to Size, it can take a few days for Apple to charge your account and to send you an email. Don't worry, though, it's not a repeat payment, just a delay.

## Print to Size is **not** a subscription
It is an old-school "paid app": you can buy the app, and it is a lifetime, [refundable](/refund), one-time purchase. Once you have purchased it is yours to use forever and you will never be charged again for it.

## Check your App Store purchases

If you are not sure you can check your App Store purchases. To see how, here is a link to Apple's instructions: [https://support.apple.com/HT204088](https://support.apple.com/HT204088)
