Print to Size has its own file format that you can use to save and later edit your page. But most of the time you just want to print something and not keep your document after printing. So this feature is kept out of the way and your are presented with a blank page when you start the app.

## To save your work for later

* Tap on the Print icon
* Tap on Save for Later
* Choose a location where you wish to save your document (for example iCloud)
 
## To resume your work 

* On your iOS device, find the document at the location your exported it to, and tap on it
* Choose "Open in Print to Size"

Now you know how to do this if you need to!
