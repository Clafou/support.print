Did you tap "Print", and find that nothing is happening? Then have a look at your print queue to see if a print job is not being processed.

To view your print queue (and cancel jobs if needed) you can access a little-known iOS feature called Print Center. See the last section on [this Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201387) to see how to open Print Center.
