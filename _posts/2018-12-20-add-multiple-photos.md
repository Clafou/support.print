title: How to Add Multiple Photos At Once
categories: [Troubleshooting]
---

This issue is resolved with iOS 14 and its new image picker.

But if you are using an older version of iOS, the + button only allows you to select one photo at a time. If you are printing a lot of photos it can be tedious to reopen the image picker multiple times.

However you can add multiple images at once from your Photos app by via copy/paste or, if you are using an iPad, via drag & drop.

## Method 1: Copy/Paste

* Open your Photos app (or your other app such as Google Photos)
* Tap on Select
* Select multiple photos
* Tap on the Export button
* Tap on Copy
* Return to Print to Size
* Tap on a blank part of the page
* Tap on Paste

## Method 2: Drag and Drop on iPad

See [this page](https://www.imore.com/how-use-drag-and-drop-ipad) to learn how to use this approach on iPad.

Note: Because drag & drop across apps is an iPadOS-only feature, this method does not work on iPhone and iPod Touch.
