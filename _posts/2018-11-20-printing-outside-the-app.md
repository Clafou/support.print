Use this method if you are having issues printing directly from the app.

If you have installed your printer's manufacturer's own app:

1. Tap on the Print icon.
2. Tap on "Export as JPG"
3. Tap on your printer manufacturer's app
4. Ensure the correct paper size is selected then print

Otherwise you may be able to print using iOS:

1. Tap on the Print icon.
2. Tap on "Export as PDF"
3. Tap on "Print" in the bottom row
4. Select your printer and print
