### Version 1.7.2 and iOS 13

* If you are using iOS 13 (or iPadOS 13), nothing happens when you tap print for the second (and subsequent) time. For now you can avoid this bug by re-selecting your printer:
    * Tap on the Print icon to open the Print panel
    * Open the printer chooser by tap on your printer's name
    * Tap on your printer's name to re-apply your choice.
    * You should now be able to print successfully again.

### Version 1.6.3

* For some unlucky users the app won't lauch and is stuck on a blank screen. To solve this just restart your iPhone/iPad.
