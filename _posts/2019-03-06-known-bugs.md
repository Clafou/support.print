### Version 1.8.4

No known bug. Please get in touch if you find one!

### Version 1.8.3 and iOS 14

* On iOS 14, adding a photo may fail due to changes in the iOS Photos privacy settings. Update your app to version 1.8.4 to get the new iOS 14 support which resolves this.

### Version 1.8.3

* When you open the app, the default paper size is A4 even if you live in the US.

### Version 1.8.2

* When you open the app, the default paper size is A4 even if you live in the US.

### Version 1.8

* A crash occurs on iOS 9. This is fixed in the version 1.8.1 update.

### Version 1.7.2 and iOS 13

* If you are using iOS 13 (or iPadOS 13), nothing happens when you print a page for the second (and subsequent) time. For now you can avoid this bug by re-selecting your printer:
    * Tap on the Print icon to open the Print panel.
    * Open the AirPrint printer chooser (tap on on your printer's name under "Printer").
    * Tap on your printer's name to re-apply your choice.
    * You should now be able to print successfully again.

### Version 1.6.3

* For some unlucky users the app won't lauch and is stuck on a blank screen. To solve this just restart your iPhone/iPad.
