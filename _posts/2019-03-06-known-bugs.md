### Version 1.8.6

Some users have reported that when they try to print a page containing multiple images, some of these images do not get printed. This appears to only affect Selphy printers. An update will be ready soon to fix this bug. Until then there is a workaround that you can use when printing multiple images if you are affected: [export as PDF or JPEG and print from there](https://support.printtosize.com/printing-outside-the-app/).

### Existing users who upgraded to iOS 14

* On iOS 14, adding an image may fail due to changes in the iOS photo gallery privacy settings. Simply [update your app](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202180#manual) to the latest version to fix this issue.

### Version 1.8.2

* When you open the app, the default paper size is A4 even if you live in the US.

### Version 1.8

* A crash occurs on iOS 9. This is fixed in the version 1.8.1 update.

### Version 1.7.2 and iOS 13

* If you are using iOS 13 (or iPadOS 13), nothing happens when you print a page for the second (and subsequent) time. For now you can avoid this bug by re-selecting your printer:
    * Tap on the Print icon to open the Print panel.
    * Open the AirPrint printer chooser (tap on on your printer's name under "Printer").
    * Tap on your printer's name to re-apply your choice.
    * You should now be able to print successfully again.

### Version 1.6.3

* For some unlucky users the app won't lauch and is stuck on a blank screen. To solve this just restart your iPhone/iPad.
