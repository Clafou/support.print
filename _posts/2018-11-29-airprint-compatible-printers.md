In order to print through Print To Size your printer needs to be AirPrint-enabled. If you are not sure you can check the [list of AirPrint-enabled printers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311) to see if your model is listed.

If you find that your printer does not support AirPrint you can probably still use Print to Size to lay out your page but print it in a different program. See [this support page](/printing-outside-the-app/) for instructions on doing that.
