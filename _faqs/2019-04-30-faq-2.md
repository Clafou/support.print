title: I can't connect to my printer

The app uses AirPrint, the built-in printing system used by iOS. To successfully use AirPrint your printer needs to be AirPrint compatible ([tap here for the list of AirPrint printers](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311)). If you have just turned on your printer, it can take up a minute before it becomes visible to your iPhone/iPad. In some cases it helps to restart your wifi router, your printer, and you iOS device.
